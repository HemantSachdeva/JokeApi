# What is this repo about?

This repo is about the source code of my simple web application based on a <a href="https://jokeapi.dev/#try-it">JokeAPI</a> which provides random jokes according to the category we chose. Not only this, it also allows us to blacklist some kind of jokes.<br>
It is developed using <a href="https://python.org">Python </a> and <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/">Flask</a> and deployed on <a href="https://heroku.com">Heroku</a>.

#### Note: due to the different types of humor, JokeAPI contains a wide variety of jokes, of which some are very offensive. They can be filtered out, but use this API at your own risk!

#### Want to know how JokeAPI works? The [developer documentation](https://github.com/Sv443/JokeAPI/tree/version/2.4.0/dev/docs/home.md#readme) (work in progress) explains it.
